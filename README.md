\# PatchFest Multiplayer Racer (Boilerplate)



This repository contains a minimal multiplayer racing game skeleton.



It includes:

\- Room creation (server)

\- UDP broadcast room discovery

\- TCP real-time movement sync

\- Pygame client rendering



This is intentionally minimal so PatchFest contributors will build all game features.
